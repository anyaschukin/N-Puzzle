# TO DO #
#########

ARCHITECTURE
{x} organize src files -> GO-style
{x} be able to 'go build ...'
{x} store useful functions in new Golang library (filterUnique)

PARSING
{x} EITHER file OR flags
{ } print usage
{x} filter out negative numbers
{x} filter out floats
{x} filter out duplicates   ... should these be admissible ??
{x} leave empty space (0) in random board generation
{ } are both row and col between 0 and (n - 1) ?

SOLVER
{x} test IsSolvable
{x} Neighboring boards: generate a board per move
{x} move pieces around the board
{x} how do I know if I am at the goal state?
{x} bloom filter
{ } ability to choose heuristic from command line
{x} solves puzzle size 3, doesn't solve size 4
{x} MUST: priority queue
{x} MUST: A* 
{ } MUST: 3 heuristics
{x} MUST: closed set (checks if node is currently in the set)
{ } MUST: total number of states in open set (time complexity)
{ } MUST: max number of states represented in memory at the same time (size complexity)
{ } MUST: ordered solution sequence
{x} MUST: solvable or unsolvable
{ } MUST: admissible = optimistic heuristic
{ } BONUS: uniform-cost and greedy-search
 
ALGO
{x} priority queue?
{x} Must: 3 heuristic functions, including Manhattan-distance
{ } Others: A-Star, IDA-Star


OPTIMIZING
{ } concurrency?
{ } Define variables as close to their usage as possible (prevent extra variables declared)
{x} When considering the neighbors of a search node, don't enqueue a neighbor if its board is the same as the board of the predecessor search node.
